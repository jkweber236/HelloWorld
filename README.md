# Overview

This is Hello World in Python. It consists of a single line that prints the familiar phrase "Hello World" to the console. The purpose of this project was to explore different IDE's and languages. I also created it to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, Github, and Python integrated together. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
